Registering a typelib:
Open the typelib library project. Go to project> references. Remove the 'WinSubHookGX Subclassing Interface' typelib reference. Save the project.
Open references again and browse to the TypeLib folder. Add the 'WinSubHookGX.tlb' file. Save the project, close, and open the group project to test it.
